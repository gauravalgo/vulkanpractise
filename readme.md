two types of coordinates system
1) polar coordinates system
2) rectangular coordinates system

x,y,z axes
r,theta,phi of point P

//  angles
 thetha-> between r & Z projection of r on z axis (anticlockwise);
 Phi -> between r & X projection of r on x axis (anticlockwise)

//vertex specification ----> the process of setting up the necessary objects for rendering with a paricular shader program. as well as process of using those objects.
// invariance --> producing the same output as the another operation.
// vertex shader ---> vertex array object. 


// There is the diffrence between a vector and a point.vectors are not points.
// But both are relative to one another.
// Vectors addition is commutative.
// Vector substraction is anti commutative.
// Unit vector is multiplication with reciprocal of magnitude.
// when a vector gets converted to the unit vector it either reduces its length or incres
// Mangnitude of the vector is given by underroot(components of x,components of y, ... )
// Normal vector is perpendicular to the surface . normalized vector is unit vector that is perpendicular to the surface. 
// There are two types of multiplication one is dot product another one is cross product .
