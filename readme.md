Two types of coordinates system
=================================
1) polar coordinates system
2) rectangular coordinates system
   x,y,z axes
   r,theta,phi of point P

Angles
=========
 thetha-> between r & Z projection of r on z axis (anticlockwise);
 Phi -> between r & X projection of r on x axis (anticlockwise)

===============
vertex specification ----> the process of setting up the necessary objects for rendering with a paricular shader program. as well as process of using those objects.
invariance           ----> producing the same output as the another operation.
vertex shader        ----> vertex array object. 

SUMMARY of Vectors and Points
===============================
1) There is the difference between a vector and a point.vectors are not points.But both are relative to one another.
2) Vectors addition is commutative.
3) Vector substraction is anti commutative.
4) Unit vector is multiplication with reciprocal of magnitude.
5) when a vector gets converted to the unit vector it either reduces its length or increses its length towards unity.
6) Mangnitude of the vector is given by underroot(components of x,components of y, ... )
7) Normal vector is perpendicular to the surface . normalized vector is unit vector that is perpendicular to the surface. 
8) There are two types of multiplication one is dot product another one is cross product .
9) If b vector is projected to a unit vector then their dot product reveals 
    1) unit_vector(a).b>0
    2) unit_vector(a).c=0
    3) unit_vector(a).d<0
10) Vector dot product is associative in nature in terms of scalar multiplication.
                        a.(bk)=(ak).b
11) a.b = component_of_x(a.b)+component_of_y(a.b).
12) Dot product is distributive in nature a.(b+c) = a.b + a.c
13) Magnitude of the displacement in a particular direction is given by dot product.
14) Cross product is only applied in 3d and it is not commutative.it is anti-commutative a*b = -b*a
15) Cross product is not associative (a*b)*c not equals to a*(b*c).
16) If a and b are parellel then a*b =0.
17) x*y=z,y*z=x,z*x=y
18) y*x=-z,z*y=-x,x*z=-y
19) magnitude of the cross product x3=x1*y2-y1x2,y3=z1*x2-x1*z2,z3=x1*y2-y1*x2
